<p style="font-size:130%;">While the worms were in the town water they were able to collect more of their worms brothers and form one giant mega worm. The mega worm seeks revenge for abandoning them and is heading straight for you. 
While you sleep like a baby in bed suddenly the ground falls from under you and both your bed and you are in a giant hole. You wake up frantically and as you look up in front of you, you're suddenly staring face to face with a giant mega worm. The worm is angry and grabs your leg. Do you.. </p>
