<p style="font-size:130%;"> You go about your day and suddenly when you are heading home you see a worm riding a bird like a horse. The worm you had left in the grass did not die he is actually the best bird rider in all of the west coast. The bird is heading straight for you, suddenly the bird stops in front of you and catches your attention. The worm had actually come to thank you for finding his lost steed.  </p>

<p style="font-size:130%;"> “thank ya, partner, I done had fuh-allen awf maah birdd and gawt gone up in smoke for a bit.  since ya put me in thuh guhrass she was able ta find me, I'm real grateful for that.” -worm </p>
<p style="font-size:130%;">  He suddenly flips you a gold coin he had and flies off into the sun. The coin turns out to be chocolate and you realize he was quite the cheapskate.</p>
