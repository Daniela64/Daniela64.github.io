<h1 style="font-size:300%;"> Meme Mashup</h1>

<img src="seashantyboom.jpg" alt="Sea Shanty" class="mx-auto d-block" width="600" height="600">


<p> A meme mashup is based on the internet meme "Pirate posting" which takes original memes and pirate-ifys them in a poorly looking fashion. This one includes the mix of the "Costco guys" a father and son duo that have become huge influencers because of their love for Costco food as well as their "Bring the Boom" song. This is a twist because the Costco guys usually give Booms as a good rating for things like food and people but when turning it into a pirate post the Booms are a play on pirate battles. I cropped out every image and added it to the Costco guys then added an extra white box to the top as well as the black text.
