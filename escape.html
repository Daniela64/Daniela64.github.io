<h1 style="font-size:300%;">Town Crazy Person</h1>

<p style="font-size:130%;">You run to the window and open it as they get closer. You manage to slip out before they catch. You run as far as you can to get help. Eventually you do find people. As you try to explain to them what had happened they look at you in concern and donâ€™t believe you one bit. They take you and emmit you into a psych war. Word gets around and you become the town crazy person. Your paranoia never ends.
