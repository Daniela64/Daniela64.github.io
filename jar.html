<p style="font-size:130%;">You put them in the jar, and you made a fully furnished bug house for me that you know would emulate their normal living habits. You leave them on a windowsill by your room and go about your day. You constantly hear scratching but can never pinpoint where it came from. It starts getting late so you decide to go to bed. In the middle of the night, the jar falls over and shatters on the floor. They are escaping. The sudden sound woke you up and suddenly you jumped out of bed and looked around in distress. The worms slitter around in your house before they make it to your room and slip in from under the door. They inch closer to you growing in size. What do you do? </p>
