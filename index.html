<p style="font-size:130%;">You are walking down the street on a dewy morning, It had rained the previous night, so most of the ground and plants around you are still wet. As you walk down the street, you come across an odd puddle. Worms are floating around in the puddle in front of you. Thats strange. You look around and realize there are also some dead worms on the sidewalk from the previous day. You are now left with three options: save the worms and carry them to shelter (a grass patch nearby), save the worms and take them to raise as your own, or kill the worms and leave them to die in the puddle in which you found them. </p>
